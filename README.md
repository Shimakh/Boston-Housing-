Housing Values in Suburbs of Boston

The medv variable is the target variable.


#### Problem


The problem is to predict the housing Values in Suburbs of Boston.


#### Dataset


The medv variable is the target variable.


The Boston data frame has 506 rows and 14 columns.


This data frame contains the following columns:
